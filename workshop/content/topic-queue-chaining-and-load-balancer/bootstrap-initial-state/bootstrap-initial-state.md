First, we will setup the initial state, including the integrating of the **Unicorn Management Service** (leveraging [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)), the **Rides Store** (leveraging [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)) and all **3 backend services** (leveraging [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)).

![Step 1](step-1.png)

#### 1. Browse to your AWS Cloud9 IDE

Browse to your [AWS Cloud9 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) and select the environment called `%INITIALS%-wildrydes-webapp-development`.

#### 2. Build the lab artifacts from source

We provide you with an [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) template which we will use to bootstrap the initial state. In the **bash tab** (at the bottom) in you **AWS Cloud9 IDE**, run the following commands to build the lab code:  

{{< highlight bash >}}
cd ~/environment/wild-rydes-async-messaging/lab-2
sam build

{{< /highlight >}}

#### 3. Deploy the application

Now we are ready to deploy the application, by running the following command in the **lab-2** directory. **Prefix stack name with your initials to avoid clashes with other participants!:**  

{{< highlight bash >}}
export AWS_REGION=$(aws --profile default configure get region)
sam deploy \
    --stack-name %INITIALS%-wild-rydes-async-msg-2 \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --guided
{{< /highlight >}}

- Confirm the first 2 proposed arguments by hitting **ENTER**.
- **Provide your initials as unique prefix for 3rd option *Parameter UserPrefix* and hit** **ENTER**.
- Confirm the next 2 proposed arguments by hitting **ENTER**.
- When you get asked **SubmitRideCompletionFunction may not have authorization defined, Is this okay? [y/N]:**, enter `y`.
- Confirm remaining proposed arguments by hitting **ENTER**.

#### 4. Wait until the stack is successfully deployed

It takes usually 4 minutes until the stack launched. You can monitor the progress of the **%INITIALS%-wild-rydes-async-msg-2** stack in your SAM CLI or your [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation). When the stack is launched, the status will change from **CREATE_IN_PROGRESS** to **CREATE_COMPLETE**.

In the meantime while your waiting, you may want to have a look at the AWS SAM template to make yourself familiar with the stack we launched. Just click on the **template.yaml** attachment below to see the content.
